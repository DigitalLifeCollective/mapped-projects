However, running a sustainable open source project is about more than just code. Projects need unique support as they grow. Early stage projects need to develop governance structures, create strategic plans, and manage finances. Mid-stage and established projects need support to diversify revenue, explore business models, and manage growing communities. Today, open source projects rely on informal networks. Advances in one domain may take years to catch on in another. And too often projects do not meet their potential due to common pitfalls (examples: leadership burnout, community management issues, governance structures that can not accommodate growth). There is a clear need for services and supportive community spaces to set conditions for success and develop leaders in open source projects across domains.\n\nOur team has experience in starting, leading, funding, mentoring, and fiscally sponsoring open source projects in the public interest. We offer programs and services designed to elevate the ecosystem, including:\n\u25cf Fiscal sponsorship bundled with strategic project support\n\u25cf Services for projects that build management, leadership, and fundraising skills\n\u25cf Services for funders focused on evaluating sustainability of investments in open source to maximize impact\n\u25cf Inclusive spaces for people to connect across domains and share knowledge\n\u25cf Support for the development of diverse leaders\n\n"}, {"URL": "https://cooby.io", "Tags": "", "Group": ["General public", "Municipalities", "Software developers"], "Image": "https://cooby.io/web/image/3941", "Stack": ["social", "networking", "consensus"], "label": "Cooby tec, Cooperative Business Systems ", "schema": 1531157324751, "Maturity": "alpha", "tag line": "Cooperative Business Systems", "Additions": "", "Relies On": ["Odoo", "WSO2", "Stellar"], "video src": "", "video url": "", "Encryption": "no", "Common name": "Cooby tec", "Description1": "A platform cooperative for business-related digital products & services.

It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner.\n\n# How Ocean Protocol Works\n\nThe Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem composed of data assets and services, where assets are represented by data and algorithms, and services are represented by integration, processing and persistence mechanisms. Ocean Protocol facilitates discovery by storing and promoting metadata, linking assets and services, and provides a licensing framework that has toolsets for pricing.\n\nA multitude of data marketplaces can hook into Ocean Protocol to provide \u201clast mile\u201d services to connect data providers and consumers. Ocean Protocol is designed so that data owners cannot be locked-in to any single marketplace. The data owner controls each dataset."}, {"URL": "https://www.coalaip.org/", "Tags": ["music", "film", "art", "licensing", "copyright", "copyleft"], "Group": ["Artists", "Designers", "Legal professionals", "Librarians", "Software developers"], "Image": "https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580e260dcd0f6890be647e1f/t/580f4252414fb5635eb24925/1484906053186/?format=1500w", "Stack": ["legal", "semantic"], "label": "COALA IP", "schema": 1531157324751, "Maturity": "first release", "tag line": "", "Additions": "", "Relies On": "IPLD", "video src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hF9RaUAy-6g", "video url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF9RaUAy-6g", "Encryption": "yes", "Common name": "", "Description1": "COALA IP is an open specification for describing, registering, and licensing intellectual property on decentralized systems, especially blockchains.", "Description2": " The COALA IP group is collaborating to design and implement a free and open specification for representing and licensing intellectual property.
