Girl Scouts, middle schoolers, millennials gathering for Passover, and SF Gay Men\u2019s Knitting have all participated. We will be at community centers, music festivals and street fairs throughout the summer and fall - teaching and making pieces of yarn art with every community the Bay Area has to offer. And the word is out. We are now receiving pieces from as far away as Maine, Boston and Miami.\nAs these pieces of yarn art arrive from around the country, they are assembled and sewn into large panels of one of three dimensions; 36\u201d x 48\u201d, 36\u201d x 60\u201d and 36\u2019x72\u201d. These panels are then wrapped around columns of the same height. As of the writing of this proposal we have over 30 completed columns, on our way to more than 100 colorful, bold, wildly unique, and individual yarn-based sculptural forms, each representing the equally unique and beautiful people who created them.\nThe project will be exhibited at Fort Point National Historic Site starting in May 2019 for four months, free and open to the public. We are particularly proud of securing this location. Fort Point, a National Park Service site, stands as the gateway to the entire Bay Area, and within view of Angel Island-the west coast immigration station located in San Francisco Bay. We will continue to accept contributions and create columns throughout the Project\u2019s lifecycle.

We think it's time to rise above division and come together to celebrate what we all have in common - citizenry in a nation composed of diverse backgrounds, families, politics, faiths, identities and ideas. \nThe Immigrant Yarn Project (IYP) is the largest work of crowd sourced art in the country but it is not just a massive work of public art, it is a massive work of community building. We have started knitting circles at retirement centers, and high schools. We have hosted pompom shacks at museums and street fairs. Girl Scouts, middle schoolers, millennials gathering for Passover, and SF Gay Men\u2019s Knitting have all participated. We will be at community centers, music festivals and street fairs throughout the summer and fall - teaching and making pieces of yarn art with every community the Bay Area has to offer. And the word is out. We are now receiving pieces from as far away as Maine, Boston and Miami.\nAs these pieces of yarn art arrive from around the country, they are assembled and sewn into large panels of one of three dimensions; 36\u201d x 48\u201d, 36\u201d x 60\u201d and 36\u2019x72\u201d. These panels are then wrapped around columns of the same height. As of the writing of this proposal we have over 30 completed columns, on our way to more than 100 colorful, bold, wildly unique, and individual yarn-based sculptural forms, each representing the equally unique and beautiful people who created them.\nThe project will be exhibited at Fort Point National Historic Site starting in May 2019 for four months, free and open to the public. We are particularly proud of securing this location. Fort Point, a National Park Service site, stands as the gateway to the entire Bay Area, and within view of Angel Island-the west coast immigration station located in San Francisco Bay. We will continue to accept contributions and create columns throughout the Project\u2019s lifecycle. In this way, the IYP is a living organic and changing work of art.\n"}, {"URL": "https://hi-project.org/", "Tags": ["accessibility", "inclusion", "self-sovereignty"], "Group": ["General public"], "Image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/507215799619043328/5hcHIU_q_400x400.png", "Stack": ["human interface"], "label": "The hi:project", "schema": 1530787479491, "Maturity": "concept", "tag line": "empowering you, empowering us all, with a more human web", "Additions": "", "Relies On": "", "video src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oh5QuaYs49c", "video url": "https://youtu.be/oh5QuaYs49c", "Encryption": "yes", "Common name": "", "Description1": "The way a machine or service helps you accomplish tasks with or through it, that\u2019s the user interface.
