  "description": "An open source, free social web server for integrated social communications utilising decentralised communications and linkage to several indie social projects - as well as popular mainstream providers. Your \"friends\" can be from Diaspora, Twitter, StatusNet, pump.io, weblogs and RSS feeds - and even email.\r\rOur mission is to free our friends and families from the clutches of data-harvesting corporations, and pave the way to a future where social communications are free and open and flow between alternate providers as easily as email does today.",
