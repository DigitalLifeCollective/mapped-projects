  "description": "Hubz are independent general-purpose websites that not only connect with their associated members and viewers, but also connect together to exchange personal communications and other information with each other. This allows hub members on any hub to securely and privately share anything; with anybody, on any hub - anywhere; or share stuff publicly with anybody on the internet if desired.\r\rHubzilla is the server software which makes this possible.",
