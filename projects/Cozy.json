  "description": "Cozy is an app-based personal cloud you host at home. It turns a low-cost piece of hardware like a Raspberry Pi 2 or an online VPS into a powerful app platform. Cozy is evolving from a personal private cloud and app platform into a universal tool that can help you organize your life and make you more productive by automating routine tasks. It will act as your own personal assistant, providing the information you're looking for and offering advice when you need it. We want Cozy to be of use to both individual users and certain businesses as a solid foundation for building a vendor-neutral cloud platform.",
