  "description": "(n+1)sec is a Free (libre), end-to-end secure, synchronous, multi-party messaging protocol. The (n+1)sec project, similar to the OTR (off-the-record) project, makes it possible to have secure instantaneous communications between people. (n+1)sec extends upon OTR in supporting not just one-to-one chats, but also chats between arbitrary groups of people. Like OTR, (n+1)sec is built on top of arbitrary chat infrastructure systems, such as XMPP, and can be implemented in any client for these systems.",
