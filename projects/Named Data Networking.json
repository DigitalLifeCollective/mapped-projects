  "description": "Developing a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths \u00e4\u00f3\u00ee and address weaknesses \u00e4\u00f3\u00ee of the Internet\u00e4\u00f3\u00bbs current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth.
