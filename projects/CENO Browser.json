Traditional circumvention technologies require the user to connect directly to a proxy in the uncensored zone. This design gives the censor an advantage in locating and blocking popular proxies, VPN servers, relays, bridges, etc.\n\nCENO proposes a fundamentally different solution: reduce the requests to externally available proxy servers and enable the storage of retrieved content inside the censored zone. CENO's advantage comes from being both a transport and a storage solution.\n\nPeer-to-peer routing is the ideal solution for the \u201ccat and mouse\u201d scenario that most circumvention providers end up playing with the censor. Clients need not know the location of a proxy to relay censored content, instead using small-world networks to connect to their peers, and thereafter to a bridge in the uncensored zone.\n\nOnce a website is accessed by a single user (node), it is stored and continues to propagate inside the country peer-to-peer. Individual nodes are referenced by an identifier which does not give away their physical location. Content remains available inside the censored zone even if external connectivity is cut.
