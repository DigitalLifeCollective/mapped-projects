# Digital Life Collective Project Registration

Our goal is to create a transparent and traceable method for projects to become findable on the Digital Life Collective [ecosystem maps](https://kumu.io/DigLife/ecosystem-directory#map-of-maps). We are starting this project with a map to support the decentralized tech community. You can [add your project to the decentralized tech map here](https://forms-diglife.herokuapp.com/#/form/11f40902f7c7485e), and [see the map here](https://kumu.io/DigLife/decentralized-tech).
